            <h2 id="what-am-i-">What Am I?</h2>
            <p>ProjectOn is an open-source multimedia projection program geared towards
            producing and running church services.</p>

            <h2 id="why-projecton-">Why ProjectOn?</h2>
            <p>Working in a smaller church, I was limited by a small budget, the small
            number of open-source church projection programs available, and few
            tech-savvy volunteers. ProjectOn seeks to provide an easy to use,
            intuitive, and responsive experience when building and running the
            projection needs of a church service.</p>

            <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
            <p>Currently, ProjectOn is available for the Microsoft Windows operating
            system only. Download the current ProjectOn installer (v.1.3.2) and run
            it on your computer.</p>

            <h2 id="using-projecton">Using ProjectOn</h2>
            <p>This information will get you started, but for more in-depth information
            on using ProjectOn, please click “Help” and “Help Contents” in the menu.</p>

            <h3 id="screen-layout">Screen Layout</h3>
            <p>When you first run ProjectOn, you’ll be greeted with a screen split into
            four main areas:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Order of Service
            </li>
            <li>Media Storage
            </li>
            <li>Preview Panel
            </li>
            <li>Live Panel
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Order of Service area is where you will place the various items to
            show during your service, such as music lyrics, bible verses, and
            images. Drag-and-drop items into this area from the Media Storage area
            or use the Media Storage’s Add to Service buttons. Drag items in the
            Order of Service to rearrange their order.</p>
            <p>In the Media Storage area, you will find tabs for the various types of
            media that can be displayed:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Song Lyrics
            </li>
            <li>Bible Verses
            </li>
            <li>Custom Slides
            </li>
            <li>Images
            </li>
            <li>Videos
            </li>
            <li>Web Slides
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Preview Panel shows you the content of what is coming up next in the
            service, while the Live Panel shows you the content of what is currently
            being displayed.</p>

            <h3 id="remote-interfaces">Remote Interfaces</h3>
            <p>The ProjectOn program, while it is running, creates a server that can be
            accessed by any browser on any device connected to the same network or
            access point. This server has three different web pages that can be
            accessed:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Remote Control
            </li>
            <li>Mobile-Friendly Remote Control
            </li>
            <li>Stage View
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Remote Control provides an application that allows you to control
            the service through another device, such as a tablet or smartphone.</p>
            <p>The Stage View shows a simplified version of any text that is currently
            being displayed on the projector. This is particularly useful for
            showing lyrics to a Praise Team.</p>
            <p>The specific web pages for these can be found by choosing “Help” and
            “About” from the menu.</p>

            <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
            <p>There are various changes that can be made to how ProjectOn works. By
            clicking on the settings icon, you will see what those changes are:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>CCLI Info
            </li>
            <li>Screen Settings
            </li>
            <li>Global Font Settings
            </li>
            <li>Global Background Settings
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have an account with CCLI (Christian Copyright Licensing
            International), you can enter your license number(s) here. This will
            ensure that your license number appears on any lyrics shown on the
            projector.</p>
            <p>In the Screen Settings you can choose which screen you would like to use
            as your display. By default, the program uses whatever monitor is
            currently set up as your “Primary” monitor and, if a second monitor or
            projector is already connected to the computer, uses that as the
            display.</p>
            <p>In the Global Font section, you can change the appearance of the text
            that is being displayed. You’ll find options for the Font Face, Size,
            Shadow, Outline, and Color of the text. Here, too, you can change the
            size of the font that appears on the Stage View.</p>
            <p>In the Global Background section you can choose the default background
            for songs and for bible passages. These changes can also be made in the
            toolbar at the top of the main window. Songs and bible verses will
            automatically used these backgrounds, unless you specify a custom
            background to use when editing a song.</p>
            <p>Here, too, you can choose a custom “Logo” image to display when nothing
            else is being shown; for example, a graphic with a welcome message.</p>

            <h3 id="shortcut-keys">Shortcut Keys</h3>
            <p>There are a variety of Shortcut Keys that can be used when using the
            program or navigating a service:</p>
